Slides as printed cards.</p> <p>PowerPoint, <a href="http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/">Deck.js</a>, and the like are fantastic when sharing with large groups of people — from a classroom full of folks to a web full of folks. But, what if easy and broad sharing isn't a criteria for your pitch deck?</p> <p><a href="http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/pitch-med.gif"><img src="http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/pitch-med.gif" alt=""></a></p> <p>You might end up with physical cards like I did when I recently pitched <a href="http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu/blog/2016/09/02/private-talking-spaces-progress/">Private Talking Spaces</a>. The cards are surprisingly good!! Just like non-physical slides, they can provide outlines for talks and discussions, but they're so simple (just paper and ink), they won't get in the way when sharing ideas with small groups.</p> <p><a href="http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_7287.jpg"><img src="http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_7287-1024x683.jpg" alt=""></a></p> <p>The operation of the cards is as plain as can be - just take the card off the top, flip it upside down, and put it to the side. </p> <p><a href="http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_7289.jpg"><img src="http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_7289-1024x683.jpg" alt=""></a></p> <p>n cards = n screens in the world of physical pitch decks. I wish we had multiple projectors in rooms! In the photo above, I pin my agenda card up top.</p> <p>I drew the slides in Adobe Illustrator. They're six inches square and printed on sturdy paper. If you'd like to make your own, here's <a href="http://lil.law.harvard.edu/img/pts-pitch.ai">my .ai file</a> and here's <a href="http://lil.law.harvard.edu/img/pts-pitch.pdf">a .pdf version</a>.</p> <p>It feels like there's something here.

He said a whole bunch of interesting things, but the thing stuck most with me is his advice on staffing a lab. He said something like "Bring in people that are focused on solving a problem. If they have a project you want to support and grow, bring them in and give them space to build that thing." Totally sold on this idea. Projects often need the stamina and focus of a single person (two people feels good too) to jam it through to success.</p> <div class="embed-container"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" mozallowfullscreen="" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/187993946" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="640"></iframe></div> <p><a href="http://www.prokopbartonicek.com/jller-ignorance-with-benjamin-maus-2015">Jllr</a> by Benjamin Maus, Prokop Bartoníček — A beautiful, relaxing, rock sorting machine.

We need a versioning and change tracking system for around 50 million XML files, and no existing solutions seem to fit.</p> <h2 id="about-the-project">About The Project</h2> <p>The Caselaw Access Project or CAP, previously known as Free The Law, is making all U.S. case law freely accessible online. For more information, see <a href="/projects/caselaw-access-project">our project page</a>, and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/29/us/harvard-law-library-sacrifices-a-trove-for-the-sake-of-a-free-database.html">this New York Times article</a>.</p> <h2 id="our-tracking-task">Our Tracking Task</h2> <p>Like most digitization projects, we generate many page images. The binary image files rarely change and are not difficult to track. However, in addition to images, we create rich XML files containing descriptive/structural metadata and OCR. As we uncover mistakes in the OCR, encounter metadata anomalies, and gather new data through CAP-facilitated research projects, we will need to update these files. Tracking those changes is going to be a bit more difficult.</p> <h3 id="the-files">The Files</h3> <p>We are scanning about 37,000 volumes. Each volume contains multiple pages (obviously) and multiple cases. Usually, a case takes up a few pages, but some cases are so small that several can fit on one page, so there's no direct parent/child relationship between them. Cases never span volumes.</p> <p>If you're interested in checking out a case for yourself, you can grab a sample case with all the associated files <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0XytYvCOEw-YU41MWNyVEJfNlE/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p> <p>How we split these things up into files:</p> <h3 id="for-each-volume">For each volume:</h3> <ul class="lil-list"> <li>One METS XML file with all volume-level metadata (~ 1 MB avg)</li> </ul> <h3 id="for-each-page-side">For each page side:</h3> <ul class="lil-list"> <li>One lossless jp2 (~2.5 MB avg)</li> <li>One 1-bit tiff (~60 KB avg)</li> <li>One <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALTO_(XML)">ALTO v3 XML</a> file (~75 KB avg)</li> </ul> <h3 id="for-each-case">For each case:</h3> <ul class="lil-list"> <li>One METS XML file, which includes the text of each case body, and all case-level metadata (~75 KB avg)</li> </ul> <h3 id="the-scale">The Scale</h3> <ul class="lil-list"> <li>Roughly 37k volumes, so about 37,000 volume XML files</li> <li>Roughly 40mil page-sides, so that many jp2s, tiffs, and ALTO XML files</li> <li>A bit fewer than 10 million Cases, so that many Case METS XML files</li> </ul> <h2 id="our-key-requirements">Our key requirements:</h2> <h3 id="data-set-versioning">Data Set Versioning</h3> <p>Ideally this could be done at the corpus or series level (described below.) This would be useful to researchers working with larger sets of data.</p> <h3 id="sanitizable-change-tracking">Sanitizable Change Tracking</h3> <p>As is the case with most change-tracking systems, when recording changes, we usually want to be able to ascertain the state of the data before the change, whether this is by recording the old version and the new version, or the delta between the two versions. However, with some change types, we do require the ability to either delete the delta or the old data state. Ideally, we would be able to do this without removing the entire change history for the file.</p> <h3 id="file-authentication">File Authentication</h3> <p>People should be able to check if the version of the file they have is, or ever has been in our repository.</p> <h3 id="open-data-format">Open Data Format</h3> <p>Even if the change/versioning data isn't natively stored in an easily human-readable format, it must at least be exportable into a useful open format.

A series is a numbered sequence of volumes from a particular court, such as the Massachusetts Reporter of Decisions. The largest series so far contains approximately 1k volumes, 750k pages, and 215k cases, but they are rather inconsistently sized, with the smallest containing only one volume, and the average containing 71. There are 635 series in total.</p> <p>Many data consumers will want only case files, and not per-page or per-volume files. It may make sense to store case XML files and non-case-XML files in separate repositories.</p> <h2 id="what-we-need-from-you">What We Need From You</h2> <p>Ideas.

You quickly realize the outline is made of buzzing flies. The monitor/camera is surrounded by fantastic printed portraits generated by the installation.</p> <p><a href="http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_6504.jpg"><img src="http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_6504-1024x768.jpg" alt="IMG_6504"></a></p> <iframe height="700" width="394" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" mozallowfullscreen="" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/182327998?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" webkitallowfullscreen=""></iframe> <p><strong>Body Pressure</strong> (this is a placeholder name until I track down the correct name) — lay down on a large deflated bag and feel it lift you toward another inflating bag.

Lots of thinking about how to create equity in shared spaces in libraries. Lots of thinking about how to increase focus for folks talking on phones (and maintain the focus of those around them not talking on phones). Lots of thinking about where private talking spaces might be located in libraries. So much thinking!!</p> <p>Much of the labor has been contributed by our collaborator, Nic Schumann, at <a href="http://workshopri.com/">Work-Shop</a>.
