Run with it.  Modify it. Whatever. I got obsessed with the idea of sharing sites whole hog.  The site meets our needs as a lightweight wordpress CMS.  Wordpress was complicated enough. Maybe you find yourself in that position—or just want a pretty simple site that makes hovering things fun. <a href="https://github.com/harvard-lil/website"> It's on github</a>.  It ain't all polished and buffed under the hood, and lot's more documentation to come, but our site's out. Make it your site, or improve it so we can add your changes to our site.</p> <p>The site will take on more and more of its own character over time, but we've rebooted.  And it seems like it's time.</p> </div> </article> </div> </section> <section class="_posts"> <div class="sleeve"> <article id="post-" role="article" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"> <header> <time class="post-date" datetime="2012-07-31T21:44:03+00:00" pubdate>July 31, 2012</time> <h1 class="post-title" itemprop="headline">Library e-book licensing: overview</h1> <p class="post-author">Posted by <a href="/about/#david-weinberger">David Weinberger</a></p> </header> <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody"> <p>The Berkman Center's <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/people/dobrien">David O'Brien</a>, <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/ugasser/">Urs Gasser</a>, and <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/palfrey/">John Palfrey</a> have just posted a 29-page "<a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2111396">briefing paper</a>" on the various models and licenses by which libraries are providing access to e-books.</p> <p>It's not just facts 'n' stats by any means, but here are some anyway:</p> <blockquote> <p>According to the 2011 Library Journal E-Book Survey, 82% of libraries currently offer access to e-books, which reflects an increase of 10 percentage points from 2010. … Libraries maintain an average of 4,350 e-book copies in a collection.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>[T]he publisher-to-library market across all formats and all libraries (e.g., private, public, governmental, academic, research, etc.) is approximately $1.9B; of this, the market for public libraries is approximately $850M</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>92% of libraries use OverDrive as their e-book dealer</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Of the major publishers, only Random House allows unrestricted lending of e-books.</p> </blockquote> <p>I found the section on business models to be particularly clarifying.</p> </div> </article> </div> </section> <section class="_posts"> <div class="sleeve"> <article id="post-" role="article" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"> <header> <time class="post-date" datetime="2012-07-23T21:03:02+00:00" pubdate>July 23, 2012</time> <h1 class="post-title" itemprop="headline">LIL on github</h1> <p class="post-author">Posted by <a href="/about/#matt-phillips">Matt Phillips</a></p> </header> <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody"> <p>Group hug at <a href="https://github.com/organizations/harvard-lil">github</a>.</p> <p>We've been loving github lately.

Sometimes I bump my knee on it. A big-enough Acer monitor is connected to it. I use a <a href="http://www.apple.com/magicmouse/">Magic Mouse</a> because the cord was cramping my style. My folding <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-PX-100-Lightweight-Collapsible/dp/B000089GN3">Sennheiser headphones</a> are not audiophile approved, but they suit me just fine.</p> <p>At home I have a MacBook Air. I think I'm the only one in the world who despises the MacBook Air.</p> <p>When I go to meetings, I generally bring a <a href="http://rhodiapads.com/">Rhodia notebook</a> and <a href="http://www.zebrapen.com/products/pen/f-301?c=30">Zebra pen</a> along. More often than not I also have a snack and the <a href="http://www.tealuxe.com/component/page,shop.product_details/flypage,tealuxe-hg-flypage.tpl/product_id,606/category_id,24/option,com_virtuemart/Itemid,1/">cheapest clear mug I cound find in Harvard Square</a>, filled with water or tea. I live in fear that Republic of Tea will stop selling their <a href="http://www.republicoftea.com/passionfruit-papaya-black/p/V00589/">Passion Fruit Papaya blend</a>.</p> <p>Sometimes I use my window as a refrigerator. I can fit a sandwich between the two panes of glass.</p> <p><strong>And what software?</strong></p> <p><a href="http://www.charcoaldesign.co.uk/magical">MagiCal</a> is the first thing I install on a new Mac.</p> <p>I constantly use <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2503">Exposé</a> to find buried windows and access the desktop.</p> <p>When working directly on the development server (which is all the time, scandalous!), I type code in <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/">BBEdit</a> and push images up with <a href="http://panic.com/transmit/">Transmit</a>. When I'm not feeling up to typing SQL in the Terminal (which is most of the time, scandalous!), I use <a href="http://www.sequelpro.com/">Sequel Pro</a> to interact with MySQL.</p> <p>I use Firefox when web developing. Firebug provides most of what I need to understand what's going on. <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/measureit/">MeasureIt</a> and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/jsonview/">JSONView</a> also help. Heck, I still use some features of the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/web-developer/">Web Developer extension</a>.

I just finished up the urban planning masters program over at the <a href="http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/">GSD</a>. I'm hanging out at the lab for the summer, working primarily on<a href="http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu/blog/2012/06/14/timeslice/"> Time/Slice</a>, a project I started in the <a href="http://librarytestkitchen.org/">Library Test Kitchen</a>. The Lab is very awesome.</p> <hr> <p><strong>What hardware do you use?</strong></p> <p>My most important hardware is my pen, which is a rotring extra-fine fountain pen. It was originally quite long; I had one break in my pocket so I sawed off the end and duct taped it. Now it fits in my pocket much better. My other piece of important hardware is a binder clip, which holds together a lot of printer paper full of my calendar, lists, notes, etc.</p> <p>I rely on my MacBook Pro (4,1) for most things. It has a vintage 2008 battery that generates excessive heat, which can be nice in the winter. I also have an i5 iMac that I use for heavier stuff (a lot of GIS). My phone is a Nokia 6315i. The antenna broke off (also a pocket-related accident), so it is super svelte now. I have a Kindle Touch that I like a lot more than I expected to.</p> <p><a href="http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/photo-15.jpg"><img src="http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/photo-15-300x252.jpg" alt="my pen writes well"></a></p> <p><strong>What software do you use?</strong></p> <p>A lot of Adobe Creative Suite, mostly Illustrator, for design. Other than that, I like free things. For mapping I do use ArcGIS, but I've gotten really into <a href="http://mapbox.com/tilemill/">TileMill</a> recently. It makes maps that are nice and pretty. I use <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/TextWrangler/">TextWrangler</a> for coding, and <a href="http://www.bean-osx.com/Bean.html">Bean</a> for typing words. When I really really need to write something, <a href="http://www.ommwriter.com/">ommwriter</a> is helpful.</p> <p><a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a> makes using my computer a lot more enjoyable, as does  <a href="http://stereopsis.com/flux/">f.lux</a> and <a href="http://jumpcut.sourceforge.net/">jumpcut</a>. <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> helps me to not lose all my important things. I use <a href="http://projects.tynsoe.org/en/geektool/index.php">GeekTool</a> for keeping important information on my desktop, such as the weather and my new year's resolutions. My computer counts <a href="http://www.electricsheep.org/">electric sheep</a> when it sleeps.</p> <p>I go back and forth between Chrome and Firefox, but with both I love <a href="https://chrometabcloud.appspot.com/">TabCloud</a> and and <a href="http://fivefilters.org/kindle-it/">being able to send articles straight to my Kindle</a>.</p> <p><strong>What would be your dream setup?</strong></p> <p>My dream setup would be a fort that could also get lots of sunlight. It would also have a little stop-motion animation setup ready to go at all times.

Sometimes I help make websites (like this one), sometimes I do <a href="http://www.librarytestkitchen.org/">classes</a> and right now, even working on some <a href="http://librarylicense.org/">policy-ish stuff</a> with folks from here and the <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/">Berkman Center</a>.</p> <p><strong>What hardware do you use?</strong></p> <p><a href="http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/crib.jpg"><img src="http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/crib-300x225.jpg" alt=""></a></p> <p>I have a mac tower that is cool.

Pretty vanilla.</p> <p>When I'm not in the office I use an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macbook_pro">i5, 15" Mac Book Pro</a>. I love this machine.</p> <p>We have a few <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell_PowerEdge">Dell PowerEdge machines</a> sitting in a closet upstairs we use for testing, data crunching, and to serve up our public site. We also have a couple of <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Amazon EC2 instances</a> we use for <a href="http://news.librarycloud.org/">Library News</a> and a skunkworks project.</p> <p>That's the bigger hardware.</p> <p>My head spends about a third of its day wrapped in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-HD515-Dynamic-Audiophile-Headphones/dp/B0001FTVDG">Sennheiser HD 515 headphones</a>.</p> <p>I occasionally break out of the digital world and scratch things out on paper. This usually happens when I'm trying to architect a piece of system or I'm working through some tough logic. I've found that I really like strips of paper for drawing out ideas. 8.5" x 11" pieces cut lengthwise are perfect.</p> <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rollerball_pen">Rollerball pens</a> are my go to.</p> <p>Paper also enters my workspace when I'm proofing a draft of a blog entry or something that I think might reach more than a handful friendly people. Paper and pen are so easy to use. They require very little cognitive overhead. They let you focus on the content and not the tools.</p> <p>I have a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad">first generation iPad</a> and a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Kindle">third generation Kindle</a>, but I rarely use them. If I want to do computer stuff, I use my laptop. If I want to read a book, I'm generally on paper. I'm not a paper fetishist, it's just that my library generally lends me non-digital items.</p> <p>My <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_4S">iPhone 4s</a> gets regular use during the day. I use it for music and for quick pictures and videos.</p> <p><strong>And what software?</strong></p> <p>Most of my day is spent in <a href="http://www.apple.com/osx/">OS X</a>. When I'm working on one of our servers, I'm in <a href="http://www.centos.org/">CentOS</a>, some <a href="http://www.redhat.com/">Redhat</a> somethignororther, or <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>.</p> <p>I rely heavily on <a href="https://github.com/quicksilver/quicksilver">Quicksilver</a> for application launching.</p> <p>I have a whole bunch of different user accounts and API keys. I use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keychain_(Mac_OS)">Keychain</a> to keep track of them.</p> <p>I manage myself using lists.

For this type of work I'll use <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a> if I'm working locally and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi">vi</a> if I'm working remotely.</p> <p>We track code using <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a> and push almost all work to <a href="https://github.com/harvard-lil">GitHub</a>.

Here's what I think might be feasible in a couple years with a generous office budget.</p> <p>I want a really great laptop. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Pro">third generation, i7, Retina display, 15 inch MacBook Pro</a>. I'd pair it with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Thunderbolt_Display">27" Apple Thunderbolt Display</a>. I'd pile all of that on a standing/sitting desk.</p> <p>I'd also create an ideal office space. No office mates. A glass wall that insulates sound very well. I want to be able to see what's going on in the common work areas and I want people to see that they can get me if needed, but I don't want the noise when I'm focusing. I'm sold on the <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2008/12/29.html">Joel Spolsky office setup</a>.</p> <p>Quick access to great coffee and water would be nice too.</p> </div> </article> </div> </section> <section class="_posts"> <div class="sleeve"> <article id="post-" role="article" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"> <header> <time class="post-date" datetime="2012-06-14T18:03:23+00:00" pubdate>June 14, 2012</time> <h1 class="post-title" itemprop="headline">Time/Slice!</h1> <p class="post-author">Posted by <a href="/about/#jessica-yurkofsky">Jessica Yurkofsky</a></p> </header> <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody"> <p><a href="http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/blog-pic2.png"><img src="http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/blog-pic2-1024x378.png" alt="ideogram"></a></p> <p>My name is Jessica and I'm hanging out at here for the summer to work on a <a href="http://osc.hul.harvard.edu/liblab">Library Lab</a> project called Time/Slice. The idea behind it is that activity and events are part of the "data" associated with a community, but that there is no one responsible for organizing/archiving/analyzing them as such. Time/Slice is a digital bulletin board for a physical place (eg a school or neighborhood) which can be housed in the library associated with that community. It takes event submissions via email with photo/video attachments. It can also pull in video of previous events (from youtube/vimeo feeds, etc.) Everything is added and sorted automatically.</p> <p>I started the project in the <a href="http://librarytestkitchen.org/">Library Test Kitchen</a> course with Jeff last semester, focusing on the Harvard Graduate School of Design and <a href="http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/#/loeblibrary/index.html">Loeb Library</a>. I ended up with a prototype that is functional but pretty buggy. You can still <a href="http://www.jessyurko.com/timeslice/index.html">check it out here</a>. (The animated blocks are entirely the work of the awesome <a href="http://isotope.metafizzy.co/">isotope jQuery plugin.</a>)</p> <p><a href="http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-shot-2012-06-14-at-12.41.11-PM.jpg"><img src="http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-shot-2012-06-14-at-12.41.11-PM-300x215.jpg" alt="time/slice prototype"></a></p> <p>There were a couple of problems with it that I'm working on fixing now: speed, storing images, navigability, and a whole lot of bugs. There are also issues around how much volume it can be expected to handle, and it needs to have an easy interface for whoever's in charge to edit content.</p> <p><a href="http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-shot-2012-06-14-at-12.46.35-PM.jpg"><img src="http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-shot-2012-06-14-at-12.46.35-PM-300x220.jpg" alt="current version screenshot"></a> current version as of this morning. not too pretty yet, eh?</p> <p>I'll post a link to what I'm working on now when it's a little more stable.</p> </div> </article> </div> </section> <section class="_posts"> <div class="sleeve"> <article id="post-" role="article" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"> <header> <time class="post-date" datetime="2012-06-12T01:34:11+00:00" pubdate>June 12, 2012</time> <h1 class="post-title" itemprop="headline">Awesome Box signs, a work in progress</h1> <p class="post-author">Posted by <a href="/about/#matt-phillips">Matt Phillips</a></p> </header> <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody"> <p>We've been having fun with the Awesome Box lately. Signage work.</p> <p>We started low-tech for <a href="http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu/blog/2012/05/17/awesome-box-pilot/">the two prototype boxes we installed last month.</a> Just a little time in Photoshop and a color printer.</p> <p><a href="http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/IMG_0240-e1339465094194.jpg"><img src="http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/IMG_0240-e1339469087348.jpg" alt=""></a></p> <p>The paper sign has some strengths. It's low cost and easy to reproduce should it get damaged. But, it really doesn't scream "Awesome." If I checked out the paper sign from my local sign lending library, I probably wouldn't return it to the Awesome Box. Let's punch up the fun.</p> <p>How about a sign with lights? Yes, please.</p> <p>We've rigged up an Arduino with a photoresistor and wired that to a few LEDs. Those LEDs get routed into a sheet of plexiglass and then sandwiched between a couple of sheets of aluminum. Place a book inside, trip the sensor, and smile.</p> <div class="embed-container"><iframe width="320" height="240" src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/43864998?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div> <p>(The wires and the rest of the circuit will be cleaned up and hidden in the base of the Awesome Box.)</p> <p>For situations in which the LED-based sign is not a good fit, we're putting together an aluminum and felt sign. The thick felt will be sandwiched between two aluminum arrows much like the LED sign. Fun and stable.</p> <p><a href="http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/IMG_0237-e1339443920742.jpg"><img src="http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/IMG_0237-e1339444055765.jpg" alt=""></a></p> <p>Stan Cotreau in the <a href="http://www.physics.harvard.edu/services/machineshop/">Harvard Physics Machine Shop</a> has been helping us fabricate the aluminum and plexi.
