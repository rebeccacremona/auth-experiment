It was so well received here that we thought it worth sharing more broadly.</p> <blockquote> <p>Hi all,</p> <p>During this time of general re-evaluation of library services, I thought it might be helpful to share a few thoughts from my vantage point as a software developer at the Harvard Library Innovation Lab regarding the relationship between our catalogers (we're in the Law Library) and the data they create and software development for library applications.</p> <p>My project work at the Lab has time and again shown the crucial importance not simply of cataloged records, but of cataloged records created to a high standard. I work primarily on data platforms, harvesting bibliographic and related data and making it accessible to other developers who create amazing tools and services for library communities.</p> <p>One of the primary challenges in this work is getting data describing books and periodicals (catalog records) to relate to data from non-library sources, such as data about book talks on YouTube or to NPR broadcasts of author interviews or to archival collections. It's all about connections in the data. The barer the data, the less described it is, the more it falls flat.</p> <p>On the bibliographic side, every new Library of Congress subject heading a cataloger adds to a record creates a rich set of connective possibilities downstream for people like me. Likewise, every uniform title entry inserted into a record allows us to show users of our software another edition of a given work in the context of all its editions – a crucial feature for any discovery service in the library materials space.</p> <p>No software can create these connections if the underlying data hasn't been carefully composed into richly structured records, based on solid analysis and comprehensive description. The difference is like that between reading a newspaper consisting of headlines only and reading one which also has accompanying articles. It is dramatic.</p> <p>I hope in moving forward that we don't lose sight of the importance of this kind of quality analysis and description.</p> <p>But also: the expertise which catalogers bring to the task of comprehensive bibliographic description has proven crucial to me as a reference resource in my work of designing software to harvest and process bibliographic information. At the Law Library, the catalogers are a few hallway steps away, and are as crucial to my being able to create smart software as anyone on my development team. I've spent countless hours, regularly throughout the years, with my cataloger colleagues exploring the complexities of MARC data structures, uniform title rulesets, authority record uses, holdings data locations, and much much more. Having them as a co-located resource has been crucial to my being able to get my software written.</p> <p>There are some amazing cross-departmental symbioses here in the Harvard Library, as well as some crucial, perhaps non-obvious, dependencies between departments. From where I'm sitting, they comprise a major, wonderfully effect part of our current ecosystem.</p> <p>Paul Deschner <br> Applications Developer <br> Harvard Library Innovation Lab</p> </blockquote> </div> </article> </div> </section> <section class="_posts"> <div class="sleeve"> <article id="post-" role="article" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"> <header> <time class="post-date" datetime="2012-05-17T15:35:52+00:00" pubdate>May 17, 2012</time> <h1 class="post-title" itemprop="headline">Awesome Box Pilot</h1> <p class="post-author">Posted by <a href="/about/#annie-cain">Annie Cain</a></p> </header> <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody"> <p><a href="http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0176.jpg"><img src="http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0176-300x225.jpg" alt=""></a></p> <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Awesome Box is now well beyond the pilot phase.

Our goal is to create products, services &amp; experiences, broadly defined, for the Harvard Library community. Generous funding to realize these projects is provided by <a href="http://history.fas.harvard.edu/people/faculty/darnton.php">Prof. Robert Darnton</a> and the <a href="http://osc.hul.harvard.edu/liblab">Harvard Library Lab</a>. Projects will be deployed in «Test Kitchens»—partner libraries, such as the <a href="http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/#/loeblibrary/index.html">Loeb</a> and <a href="http://hcl.harvard.edu/libraries/widener/">Widener</a> Libraries, that allocate portions of their public space to these experiments.</p> <p>There's a hypothesis at the heart of this seminar.  Perhaps the students know what the future of the library should be, better than we (library staff) do.  So lets put them in the drivers seat and find out.</p> </div> </article> </div> </section> <section class="_posts"> <div class="sleeve"> <article id="post-" role="article" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"> <header> <time class="post-date" datetime="2012-02-02T21:03:19+00:00" pubdate>February 2, 2012</time> <h1 class="post-title" itemprop="headline">Library Lab/The Podcast 011: A Technological Graveyard?</h1> <p class="post-author">Posted by <a href="/about/#dan-jones">Dan Jones</a></p> </header> <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody"> <p><a href="http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu/blog/wp-content/uploads/podcast/2012-02-02_marilynjohnson.mp3"><strong>Listen: 23:07</strong></a></p> <p>(<a href="http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu/blog/wp-content/uploads/podcast/2012-02-02_marilynjohnson.ogg"><strong>Also in ogg</strong></a>)</p> <p>"Your average citizen is not technologically savvy," says Marilyn Johnson, the author of <a href="http://www.marilynjohnson.net/_i_this_book_is_overdue___i__89022.htm"><em>This Book Is Overdue!: How Librarians and Cybrarians Can Save Us All</em></a></p> <p><img src="http://img2.imagesbn.com/images/103450000/103453946.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>Even as technology takes over more and more of our lives many of us are living in a technology cemetery, filled with old gadgets we have no idea how to revive, computers we don't know how to program, and ebooks we have no idea how to download to.</p> <p>Johnson argues that this is a huge opportunity for libraries to revive their place as centers of the community, for librarians to exist not just as oracles of the reference book, but as guides to the technical world.</p> <p>She spoke with David Weinberger about exactly how this might happen.</p> <hr> <p>Subscribe to the RSS of the LibraryLab podcast <a href="http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu/blog/category/podcast/"><strong>here</strong></a> to stay updated on upcoming episodes!</p> <p>Subscribe to us in <strong><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=457060447">iTunesU</a></strong></p> </div> </article> </div> </section> <div class="pagination"> <a class="small-btn" href="/blog/page/13/">&laquo; Prev</a> <span class="page_number">Page: 14 of 30</span> <a class="small-btn" href="/blog/page/15/">Next &raquo;</a> </div> <footer> <div class="sleeve"> <figure class="footer-logo"> <img src="/assets/thumbs/351x143r/lab-logo-footer-home.png" srcset="/assets/thumbs/351x143r/lab-logo-footer-home.png, /assets/thumbs/702x286r/lab-logo-footer-home.png 2x" alt="Library Innovation Lab" class="img-full-width"> </figure> <ul> <li><a href="/">Home</a></li> <li><a href="/about/">About</a></li> <li><a href="/projects/">Projects</a></li> <li><a href="/sketches/">Sketches</a></li> <li><a href="https://lil.law.harvard.edu/blog/">Blog</a></li> </ul> <div class="footer-copyright"> <p>&copy;2017 The President and Fellows of Harvard University</p> <p>The content on this site is covered under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported license unless otherwise noted.</p> </div> </div> </footer> </body> </html>
