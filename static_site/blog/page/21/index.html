Thanks to the integration of different types of objects, such as instruments, manuscripts, texts, iconography etc. Pinakes aims at transforming the traditional approach to the primary sources of the history of science into a sort of archeology of scientific knowledge. In order to achieve this ambitious project it was necessary to design a model of data-base, Pinakes, able to bring different classes of objects and items into one environment.</p> <p>…</p> <p>Pinakes has been thought as a database capable of hosting different levels of data structuring.

OCLC and Cambridge are experimenting with ways to make bibliographic data openly available. Having a reliable, open, set of bibliographic records would encourage the development of innovative applications. Or, put differently, not having a standard way to refer to books and other works has inhibited innovation. The main impediment has been the prohibitions in the licenses for this data. Perhaps this new project indicates a willingness to let an open, public catalog be created.</p> <blockquote> <p>OCLC Research and Cambridge University collaborate on Open Metadata project—28 Feb 2011</p> <p>Library information provider OCLC Research, US, and Cambridge University have announced that both organisations will jointly conduct a six-month, JISC-funded investigation into the value of making collection metadata openly available in a sustainable manner.</p> <p>The COMET (Cambridge OPen METadata) project will release a sub-set of bibliographic data from Cambridge University Library catalogues as linked data in multiple formats. This activity will test a number of technologies and methodologies for releasing open bibliographic data including XML, RDF, SPARQL, and JSON.</p> <p>To enhance linking options, records will be enriched using two OCLC Research services to assign FAST (Faceted Application of Subject Terminology) and VIAF (Virtual International Authority File) headings. This will allow for effective information retrieval and semantic interoperability.</p> <p>Starting in February 2011, COMET will document the availability of metadata for the library's collections which can be released openly in machine-readable formats and the barriers which prevent other data from being exposed in this way.</p> <p>It is expected that the project will bring value to the wider community by contributing substantially to the availability of open metadata. Linking to FAST and VIAF headings will demonstrate the potential usefulness of a structured semantic approach to data. The project will also look at the value data enrichment offers for resource discovery.</p> </blockquote> </div> </article> </div> </section> <section class="_posts"> <div class="sleeve"> <article id="post-" role="article" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"> <header> <time class="post-date" datetime="2011-02-26T17:10:14+00:00" pubdate>February 26, 2011</time> <h1 class="post-title" itemprop="headline">Has HarperCollins lost its mind or its soul?</h1> <p class="post-author">Posted by <a href="/about/#david-weinberger">David Weinberger</a></p> </header> <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody"> <p>[<em>Note: As always with posts on this blog, authors speak for themselves. - dw</em>]</p> <p>HarperCollins has <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2011/02/25/harpercollins-to-lib.html">changed its agreement</a> with the main distributor of e-books to libraries: e-books will now become inaccessible after 26 checkouts.</p> <p>I understand publishers' desire to limit ebook access so that selling one copy doesn't serve the needs of the entire world. But think about what this particular DRM bomb does to libraries, one of the longest continuous institutions of civilization. Libraries exist not just to lend books but to guarantee their continuous availability throughout changes in culture and fashion. This new licensing scheme prevents libraries from accomplishing this essential mission.</p> <p>It's beyond ironic. Until now, libraries have in fact had to scale back on that mission because there isn't enough space for all the physical books they've acquired over the years. So, they get rid of books that have fallen out of fashion or no longer seem important enough. Now that the digital revolution has so lowered the cost of storage that libraries can at last do far better at this culture-building mission, a major publisher has instituted the nightmare culture-killing license.</p> <p>So, why do I say that HarperCollins has lost its soul instead of just criticizing it for this action? Because if you cared about books as vehicles of ideas and not just vehicles of commerce, you would have dismissed with contempt an idea that treats them as evanescent as chatter on a call-in show.</p> </div> </article> </div> </section> <section class="_posts"> <div class="sleeve"> <article id="post-" role="article" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"> <header> <time class="post-date" datetime="2011-02-23T18:24:39+00:00" pubdate>February 23, 2011</time> <h1 class="post-title" itemprop="headline">StackView: The Stop-Action Version</h1> <p class="post-author">Posted by <a href="/about/#david-weinberger">David Weinberger</a></p> </header> <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody"> <div class="embed-container"><iframe width="320" height="240" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cFnuP9niRUg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div> <p>(via Cory Doctorow at <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2011/02/23/books-marching-aroun.html">BoingBoing</a>)</p> </div> </article> </div> </section> <section class="_posts"> <div class="sleeve"> <article id="post-" role="article" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"> <header> <time class="post-date" datetime="2011-02-14T19:41:45+00:00" pubdate>February 14, 2011</time> <h1 class="post-title" itemprop="headline">Why do you, or don't you, edit Wikipedia?</h1> <p class="post-author">Posted by <a href="/about/#david-weinberger">David Weinberger</a></p> </header> <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody"> <p>Wikipedia is looking for volunteers to answer some questions as they try to understand why researchers and experts do and do not contribute to Wikipedia.
