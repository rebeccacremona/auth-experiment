It's not, um, the picture of order. Here's the executive summary of the executive summary: "There is wide interpretation and varying implementations of the ISBN eBook standard." And a little more, from the first paragraph:</p> <blockquote> <p>The ISBN agency is virtually irrelevant to participants and most interviewees—including sophisticated players—do not understand or acknowledge important aspects of the ISBN standard. These aspects include the international community of ISBN countries, the ratification by ISO of the standard and important standard definitions contained in the standard. Many interviewees referred to the ISBN policies and procedures as "recommendations" or "best practices" and without correction each of these issues encourages misinterpretation of the ISBN standard policies.</p> </blockquote> <p>It's so hard to know what things are when those things are made of information and are only things by analogy.</p> </div> </article> </div> </section> <section class="_posts"> <div class="sleeve"> <article id="post-" role="article" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"> <header> <time class="post-date" datetime="2011-02-02T02:48:51+00:00" pubdate>February 2, 2011</time> <h1 class="post-title" itemprop="headline">Reflections on the Lab (about one year in for me at LIL)</h1> <p class="post-author">Posted by <a href="/about/#jeff-goldenson">Jeff Goldenson</a></p> </header> <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody"> <p>A couple months back on the airplane, I made a version of this list.

People are curious, how can we leverage this voyeurism to make great projects?</p> </li> <li><strong>See our assets with fresh eyes</strong>—Libraries have several amazing assets to leverage for innovation (that start-ups could only dream of): <br> <ul> <li> <p><em>central location</em>—public libraries, private ones, academic - libraries are always sited at the heart of everything</p> </li> <li> <p><em>librarians</em>—an interested community, a live and in-person customer support staff</p> </li> <li> <p><em>strong user base</em>—a community of patrons</p> </li> <li> <p><em>transaction data</em>—we can still identify trends, learn about the community while respecting privacy</p> </li> <li> <p><em>trust</em>—people trust libraries and librarians as purveyors</p> </li> <li> <p><em>inventory</em>—stuff (books, dvds, mags, kindles?) people want, for "free trial"</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>The Library experience</strong>—Libraries, in general, have looked the same for quite a while. The experience visiting a library, the services provided, the look hasn't changed too much. What would the most far-out, radical library be?</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Future</strong>—The future of the library is not the future of the book. But how is it not?</p> </li> <li><strong>A culture of innovation</strong>—How can we, as a Lab, both advance large projects, while also pursuing smaller ideas and experiments?</li> </ol> </div> </article> </div> </section> <section class="_posts"> <div class="sleeve"> <article id="post-" role="article" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"> <header> <time class="post-date" datetime="2011-02-01T19:48:10+00:00" pubdate>February 1, 2011</time> <h1 class="post-title" itemprop="headline">List of library projects</h1> <p class="post-author">Posted by <a href="/about/#david-weinberger">David Weinberger</a></p> </header> <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody"> <p><a href="http://www.rss4lib.com">RSS4Lib</a> has a useful list of <a href="http://www.rss4lib.com/library-labs.html">innovative library projects</a>.
