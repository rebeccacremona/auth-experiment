I'm especially interested in his comments—pointing to <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2010/11/03/meetingAtLibraryOfCongress.html">a post by Dave Winer</a>—about the role of long-lived institutions, including universities.</p> <p>Have we all concluded at this point that there is no hope of keeping a full and accurate archive? The Net is too vast, too every-changing, too complexly linked. I can't even keep a full archive of my own computer; the Mac's TimeMachine makes hourly backups, but not minutely or secondly, and it only preserves daily backups over the long-ish haul. All records are broken to one degree or another, because records require choices about what's worth recording and energy to do the recording. "Full record" is an oxymoron.</p> <p>So the question is, what is the right periodicity and scope of the Internet record we want? Usually, questions about archives and records are relative to some use case. A general record of the Net is like a general record of life. So, we'll just have to make some choices that inevitably will turn out to be wrong for some unanticipated uses. We'll have to deal with it.</p> <p>Personally, I'm heartened to see this discussion occurring at an institution with the gravitas of the Library of Congress, and that it includes people like Dan and Dave.</p> </div> </article> </div> </section> <section class="_posts"> <div class="sleeve"> <article id="post-" role="article" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"> <header> <time class="post-date" datetime="2010-11-05T17:17:55+00:00" pubdate>November 5, 2010</time> <h1 class="post-title" itemprop="headline">Google Books Getting Circulation Data from Partner Libraries</h1> <p class="post-author">Posted by <a href="/about/#kim-dulin">Kim Dulin</a></p> </header> <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody"> <p>From the Disruptive Library Technology Jester, certain libraries are providing Google Books with <a href="http://dltj.org/article/mashups-of-bib-data/#anonymized_circulation_data">anonymized circulation data</a> to feed into their relevance ranking algorithm.  I would love to know which libraries are providing this data.  Anyone?</p> </div> </article> </div> </section> <section class="_posts"> <div class="sleeve"> <article id="post-" role="article" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"> <header> <time class="post-date" datetime="2010-10-27T20:49:29+00:00" pubdate>October 27, 2010</time> <h1 class="post-title" itemprop="headline">Dave Pattern: Prestidigitator of metadata</h1> <p class="post-author">Posted by <a href="/about/#david-weinberger">David Weinberger</a></p> </header> <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody"> <p>I'm not just carelessly using the Royal We when I say that we're loving Dave Pattern's blog.

E-books are shifting from e-readers to apps as the platform of choice. Google's Android Market has surpassed 100,000 apps despite a problematic payment structure.

Why no squealing tires, no fire? Why does spending even a little of our resources on app development feel so wrong? I don't know. But, it takes only a mention of HTML5 to uncover bubbling excitement at the possibilities and to discover we've already begun expending resources.</p> <p>Apps are not here.
