Create a B&amp;N user account and upload some files, and PubIt will convert them to ePub, list your book on its site, collect money from sales, and about 60 days later will send you your money.</p> <p>Some miscellaneous <a href="http://pubit.barnesandnoble.com/pubit_app/bn?t=support#pricing_payment_terms">points</a> about PubIt: You can optionally add DRM to your books, but you don't have to. You don't need an ISBN number. You set the list price, but B&amp;N can set the sale price. You have to charge at least $0.99. You have to guarantee that you won't list it for less elsewhere.</p> <p>How much does an author make per copy? B&amp;N <a href="http://pubit.barnesandnoble.com/pubit_app/bn?t=support#pricing_payment_terms">says</a>: 65% of the list price for books priced at $2.99-$9.99, and 40% for books outside of that range. But a warning: I think I got that right, but B&amp;N refers to the money paid to "the Publisher," leaving us to figure out whether the publisher is the author or B&amp;N It's getting so hard to tell!</p> <p>(BTW, you can still buy <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/My-Hundred-Million-Dollar-Secret/David-Weinberger/e/9781847288004/?itm=1&amp;USRI=my+hundred+million+dollar+secret">books</a> published at <a href="http://www.lulu.com">LuLu.com</a> at B&amp;N.)</p> </div> </article> </div> </section> <section class="_posts"> <div class="sleeve"> <article id="post-" role="article" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"> <header> <time class="post-date" datetime="2010-10-04T17:06:05+00:00" pubdate>October 4, 2010</time> <h1 class="post-title" itemprop="headline">What we're reading</h1> <p class="post-author">Posted by <a href="/about/#david-weinberger">David Weinberger</a></p> </header> <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody"> <p>On our <a href="http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu/blog/">home page</a> and on the main blog page we run a list on the right of "Stuff we're looking at."

Go Emily!</p> <p>Written by Anthony Grafton and Jeffrey Hamburger, it is titled "Save the Warburg Library!".  In it, they explain the crisis the Warburg is in financially (hence the title).  But more importantly, they describe what makes this Art History library so unique—the cataloging scheme.  The stacks are open, and the juxtaposition of books "will bring the reader not only to the books he or she is looking for, but also to their unexpected 'good neighbours'."</p> <p><a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2010/sep/30/save-warburg-library/">http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2010/sep/30/save-warburg-library/</a></p> <p>From the Warburg Institute Library's <a href="http://warburg.sas.ac.uk/mnemosyne/entrance.htm">web site</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>The 350,000 or so volumes are classified in four sections: socia and political history (fourth floor); religion, history of science and philosophy (third and fourth floors); literature, books, libraries and education (second floor and basement); history of art (first floor, with classical art and archaeology in the basement). There are c. 2,500 runs of periodicals, about half of them current (mobile stacks in the basement). Readers have free access to the Library Holdings.</p> </blockquote> <p>Needless to say, this is very different from how the Library of Congress organizes things.  But who's to say that the LC system is better?  Different researchers have different needs, so this begs the question: <em>Can we make Harvard's collection "look" like the Warburg's?</em></p> <p>I've been looking into visualizations book collections, so what if we rendered a shelf of virtual books based on the Warburg logic?  Or Princeton Univerity's Richardson system which groups all the books by each author together?</p> <p>What are the benefits to our library singing Karaoke?</p> </div> </article> </div> </section> <section class="_posts"> <div class="sleeve"> <article id="post-" role="article" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"> <header> <time class="post-date" datetime="2010-09-21T19:53:28+00:00" pubdate>September 21, 2010</time> <h1 class="post-title" itemprop="headline">On the communication of scale.
