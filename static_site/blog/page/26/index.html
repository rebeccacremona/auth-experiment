Instead, there will be Web access and mobile apps.</p> <p>According to the article in the Telegraph, "A team of 80 lexicographers has been working on the third edition of the OED—known as OED3—for the past 21 years."</p> <p>The trajectory toward digitization has been long for the OED. In the 1990s, the OED's desire to produce a digital version (remember books on CD?) stimulated search engine innovation. To search the OED intelligently, the search engine would have to understand the structure of entries, so that it could distinguish the use of a word as that which is being defined, the use of it within a definition, the use of it within an illustrative quote, etc. SGML was perfect for this type of structure, and the <a href="http://www.opentext.com">Open Text</a> SGML search engine came out of that research. On the other hand, initially, the OED didn't want to attribute the origins of the word "blog" to Peter Merholz because he coined it in his own blog, and <a href="http://www.peterme.com/archives/00000222.html">the OED would only accept print attributions</a>. (See <a href="http://www.bradlands.com/weblog/comments/birth_of_blog/">here</a>, too.) It got over this prejudice for printed sources, however, and gave Peter proper credit.</p> </div> </article> </div> </section> <section class="_posts"> <div class="sleeve"> <article id="post-" role="article" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"> <header> <time class="post-date" datetime="2010-08-30T20:27:43+00:00" pubdate>August 30, 2010</time> <h1 class="post-title" itemprop="headline">Federal Learning Registry</h1> <p class="post-author">Posted by <a href="/about/#david-weinberger">David Weinberger</a></p> </header> <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody"> <p>This morning we had a very productive conference call (yes, there are such things, you cynics!) with Steve Midgley about the federal <a href="http://www.learningregistry.org">Learning Registry</a>.</p> <p>The Learning Registry is a new project coming out of the Dept. of Education and the Defense Department, intended to provide easier, smarter access to federal content and beyond.

Or, put differently, there is no conceivable way of pinning this number down because books are too important and too ancient to be capable of anything except arbitrary definitions. Google does it in part by making one-at-a-time human decisions: "Twice every week we group all those records into 'tome' clusters, taking into account nearly all attributes of each record." It's dirty work, but someone has to do it.</p> <p>Actually, it's dirty, messy work that would seem perfectly suited to an expert-amateur collaboration: Librarians and readers. For example, just think how valuable it would be to know that two books were <em>almost</em> considered to be the same!
