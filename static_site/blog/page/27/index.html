CIThread scours the Web for relevant content, much like a search engine does. Then the curator combs through the results to make decisions about what to publish, what to promote and what to throw away.</p> <p>As those decisions are made, the engine analyzes the content to identify patterns. It then applies that learning to delivering a better quality of source content. Connections to popular content management systems make it possible to automatically publish content to a website and even syndicate it to Twitter and Facebook without leaving the CIThread dashboard.</p> <p>There's intelligence on the front end, too. CIThread can also tie in to Web analytics engines to fold audience behavior into its decision-making. For example, it can analyze content that generates a lot of views or clicks and deliver more source material just like it to the curator. All of these factors can be weighted and varied via a dashboard.</p> </blockquote> <p>I haven't seen the software so I don't know anything about the actual implementation, but providing ever more clever computer assistance to human curators sounds like an inevitably useful path.</p> </div> </article> </div> </section> <section class="_posts"> <div class="sleeve"> <article id="post-" role="article" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"> <header> <time class="post-date" datetime="2010-07-28T16:27:12+00:00" pubdate>July 28, 2010</time> <h1 class="post-title" itemprop="headline">Harvard Library Lab to fund innovation</h1> <p class="post-author">Posted by <a href="/about/#david-weinberger">David Weinberger</a></p> </header> <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody"> <p>Harvard has <a href="http://osc.hul.harvard.edu/liblab">announced</a> the creation of the Harvard Library Lab:</p> <blockquote> <p>The Lab promotes the development of projects in all areas of library activity and leverages the entrepreneurial aspirations of people throughout the library system and beyond.

They list them in alphabetical order:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Academic library collection growth is driven by patron demand and will include new resource types.</em></p> <p><em>Budget challenges will continue and libraries will evolve as a result.</em></p> <p><em>Changes in higher education will require that librarians possess diverse skill sets.</em></p> <p><em>Demands for accountability and assessment will increase.</em></p> <p><em>Digitization of unique library collections will increase and require a larger share of resources.</em></p> <p><em>Explosive growth of mobile devices and applications will drive new services.</em></p> <p><em>Increased collaboration will expand the role of the library within the institution and beyond.</em></p> <p><em>Libraries will continue to lead efforts to develop scholarly communication and intellectual property services</em></p> <p><em>Technology will continue to change services and required skills.</em></p> <p><em>The definition of the library will change as physical space is repurposed and virtual space expands.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Hard to argue with anything on that list, beyond alphabetizing on the word "the" ðŸ™‚ Some of the items seem to bury the lede a bit, though. For example, access to digitized, full-text sources shows up at the end of the first point on the list. Under that same point, "the effect of Google Books on library collections" shows up at the end in a comma-separated list of "additional collection development trends."</p> <p>One point that the Lab is particularly interested in that didn't make it explicitly onto the list: Â The rise in value of library metadata. There's tons of it around. It can be of incredible and continuing use to anyone trying to find or understand items in (or linked to) collections of all sorts. Library metadata is going to be big!

<p><strong>Voice</strong> â€” attitude, style, personality, you should feel like your consuming media (CNN, Fox News) when you're interacting</p> <p><strong>Less Is More</strong> â€” Great services are simple.Â  Example: delicious (which drives our "what we're reading" section).Â  You can do very little but still be powerful.</p> <p><strong>Programmable</strong> â€” APIs, read/write APIs, Absolutely essential to let others contribute functionality to your application.</p> <p><strong>Personal</strong> â€” Avatars, Backgrounds, UGC, so people can feel ownership</p> <p><strong>"RESTful"</strong> â€” Everything in the application has a url.Â  And the url has clean and understandable path.Â Â  This way the web can access your app in deep ways.Â  Build on an open architecture.</p> <p><strong>Discoverable</strong> â€” Build from the ground up to be discoverable through google, but also through Social Media.Â  Build from the ground up to be viral.Â  So it can push itself.</p> <p><strong>Clean</strong> â€” The app has to be simple visually, not busy on the page.Â  Lots of space.Â  Big fonts.Â  Not too much functionality per page.Â  Very inviting.Â  <a href="http://www.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a> is a great exampleÂ  you just know what to do.</p> <p><strong>Playful</strong> â€” Have fun.Â  The ability to play in an application.Â  Foster a game dynamic.Â
